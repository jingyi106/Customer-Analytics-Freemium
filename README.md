# Customer-Analytics-Freemium
This project aims at using data mining to solve marketing problems. This case examines the fictitious company, High Note, which is an online music streaming service where the majority of users are free subscribers.  The “freemium” model allows for users to build a profile and use the service for free.  They hear advertisements at regular intervals.  Paid subscribers receive more features and hear no ads.  You should think about how freemium can be monetized and what is new with this freemium model.  In the case, the High Note employees turn to customer data to try and figure out how to increase paid subscriptions.
